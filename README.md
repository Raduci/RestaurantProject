- MySQL Server
- An IDE compatible with Java (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

## Installation

1. **Download and Configure the Project**

   Clone this repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/username/delicii-urbane.git
   cd delicii-urbane
   ```

2. **Configure JavaFX**

   Ensure you have JavaFX SDK installed and properly configured in your IDE. You can download JavaFX SDK from [openjfx.io](https://openjfx.io/).

   Add JavaFX libraries to your project. In IntelliJ IDEA, you can do this as follows:

   - Go to File > Project Structure > Libraries
   - Add the `.jar` files from the `lib` directory of the JavaFX SDK

3. **Configure MySQL**

   - Install MySQL Server if not already installed. You can download it from [mysql.com](https://www.mysql.com/).
   - Create a new database for the project:

     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE delicii_urbane;
     ```

   - Create the necessary tables. You can use the following SQL script as an example:

     ```sql
     USE delicii_urbane;

     CREATE TABLE products (
         id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
         name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         description TEXT,
         price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
         image_url VARCHAR(255)
     );

     CREATE TABLE orders (
         id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
         product_id INT,
         quantity INT,
         total_price DECIMAL(10, 2),
         order_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
         FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(id)
     );
     ```

   - Configure database connection in your Java application. You can use a properties file to store database configuration details.

     ```properties
     # db.properties
     db.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/delicii_urbane
     db.username=root
     db.password=yourpassword
     ```

4. **Configure CSS**

   The CSS files for styling the application are included in the project in the `src/main/resources/css` directory. Ensure these files are in the resource path.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**

   In your IDE, navigate to the main class of the application, typically named `Main.java`, and run the application.

   ```sh
   src/main/java/com/deliciiurbane/Main.java
   ```

2. **Navigating the Application**

   - **Main Screen**: You will see a list of available culinary products.
   - **Search**: Use the search bar to find specific products.
   - **Product Details**: Click on a product to view details and place an order.
